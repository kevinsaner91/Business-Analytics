# Starting Situation and Work Order
*Model and analyze the following situation using a simulation tool (Simmer or something else). In a system, customers arrive with a specific distribution:*

a) with fixed interarrival times of 120 sec
b) with interarrival times uniformly distributed between 60 and 180 sec
c) with exponentially distributed interarrival times with expected value 120 sec.

*Each of the customers first needs to travel to one service station. The distance is 10m and for the speed 0.5 m/s can be assumed. In total, there are three service stations available for customers.*

*Consider the following two types of assigning service stations to customers:*

1. a round robin method (first customer travels to first service station, second customer to second service station, third customer to third service station, fourth customer to the first service station, etc.)
2. the service stations have a common queue and the next customer is served by the service station which becomes first available (or by an arbitrary service station in case of more than one being available). Distinguish the two cases that the common queue is before the way to the stations (2a) or after it, i.e. directly in front of the service stations (2b). 

*Assume that the service stations require service times, which are uniformly distributed between 300 sec and 400 sec. Further specifications of the system are not given and can be chosen freely.*

*Analyze all 9 combinations of the above assumptions (i.e., a1, b1, c1, a2a, b2a, c2a, a2b, b2b, and c2b) by simulation runs of about 4 hours. During the simulations check for situations of congestion and try to answer the following questions:*

* How many customers are served on average during an hour at each of the service stations?
* What is the degree of utilization at each of the service stations?
* What is the average length of the queues?
* What is the average throughput time of the customers?

*Please provide a written report of your results. You should describe the main modeling concepts as well (e.g., design of the system and used elements) including code and problems observed during modeling and simulation runs (if there were any).*

```

## Main Modeling Concepts

In this section, we will go over the main concepts of simulation modeling. All given values, like interarrival time or timeout are defined as global variables. The following lines of code were used to spawn the customers during simulation to represent the circumstances of the interarrival times of a, b, and c:
  
a) For fixed interarrival times of 120 seconds:
```
add_generator("customer", customer, from_to(0, run_time, function() {fix_interarrival_time}))
```

b) For interarrival times uniformly distributed between 60 and 120 seconds:
```
add_generator("customer", customer, from_to(0, run_time, function() {runif(1, min = unif_interarrval_time_lwr, max = unif_interarrval_time_upr)}))
```

c) For exponentially distributed interarrival times with an expected value of 120 seconds:
```
add_generator("customer", customer, from_to(0, run_time, function() {rexp(1, rate = exp_interarrival_time)}))
```

Customers must travel to the service station and cover a distance of 10 meters at 0.5 m/s, therefore a timeout of 20 seconds ($\frac{10m}{0.5m/s}$) is added at the corresponding position.
```
timeout(function() {travel_time})
``` 

The service's time is implemented as a uniformly distributed timeout between 300 and 400 seconds: 
```
timeout(function() {runif(1, min=service_time_lwr, max=service_time_upr)})
```  

The difference in the implementation between the cases in 1 and the cases 2A and 2B consists of 3 real resources with an own queue each in 1:

Case 1 (Round Robin) is modeled as follows with 3 real resources with an own queue.
```
add_resource("service_station_1", 1) %>% 
add_resource("service_station_2", 1) %>% 
add_resource("service_station_3", 1) 
```
Cases 2A and 2B are modeled with a common resource but increased capacity of 3.
```
add_resource("service_station", 3)
```

The results obtained are stored in a result matrix, which is presented and discussed in the end. 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# I dont get this
# 
# *As consequence of this approach, the results of all cases of 2A and 2B covering the different service stations are divided through 3. This is the case because it is not possible to simulate this situation differently with simmer because adding resources adds a queue automatically which would then violate the requirements of the scenario. Can be seen [here](https://r-simmer.org/reference/add_resource.html). In addition to that the policy of the queues would end up affecting the results in a negative way. So for example all "-available-ending" policies raised errors which can't be handled properly and result in missing customers in the simulation as soon as an error is thrown but not logged. Can be found [here](https://r-simmer.org/reference/select.html).*  
# 
# All further modeling aspects are briefly described and illustrated in the simulation of the respective case. In addition to that comments in the code describe the reason of the actions where they are performed.

## *Overview of all results*

The following table shows all results of the different simulations performed with simmer.
```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
kable(result_matrix)
```

A detailed analysis can be found in the answers of the following questions.

_-How many customers are served on average during an hour at each of the service stations?_
The calculations are done with the seed 90 (```set.seed(90)```). This ensure the reproducibility of the simulation of 4 hours.

According to the results of our simulation, A2B would be the best solution with total **29.25** served customers per hour and **9.83** served customers per hour and station ($29.25/3 \approx 9.83$). Nevertheless, the random generation in the simulation has to be considered and other seeds might result in slightly other numbers. The second best system, B2B with unifrom distributed times between 60 and 180 seconds is showing promising results as well. Situations where the distribution of the arrival time leans towards 180 seconds instead of 60 seconds might have better outcomes. Additionally, the service time is fluctuating in all simulations what might influences the results as well. Generally, all system are quite close in regards of their performance.

Assuming an average arrival rate of 3600/120/3 = **10** is indicating that all systems are unstable since this assumed arrival rate is larger than all the service rates. Nevertheless, A2B and B2B are close to a stable system in our simulation.

_-What is the degree of utilization at each of the service stations?_  
Considering that simmer simulates a service system with one queue for three service station as a single queue with the capacity of three. Therefore, the individual service station results of X2A and X2B cannot be displayed separately which leads to three identical values in these cases.

The degree of utilization at each of the service stations is bellow 100% as in the beginning the first 2 service stations are idle. The third service station gets the first customer on average only after 120s of service. So even if the customer arrival rate is higher than the service rate, the service station with the highest utilization is only at 0.96 % (A2B). Additionally, the service stations are not fully utilized are the 20 seconds walking time where the customer walks from the queue to the service station (1A, 1B, 1C, A2A, B2A, C2A). During this time the service stations are idle as well.

_-What is the average length of the queues?_   
Consider the same as above, how simmer simulates a service system with one queue for multiple service stations.

The average length of the queues is between 0.68 (A2B) and 6.01 (C2A). The simulation shows heavily different results. This might be reasoned by the simulation duration of only 4 hours. Most of the scenarios are just fine in the beginning and become worse over the simulation time. The plots in the following show for most queues a positive slope for the customer flowtime, the rising flowtime increases the queue length over time - which is the case for simulations A1, B1, A2A, B2A and C2B. As already identified before, also the plots for A2B and B2B show an almost stable system too. The plots for C1 and C2A are special because the plots show an rising and decreasing throughput time, which lead to increasing and decreasing queue length as well. We assume this happens because of the exponential distribution of the customer interarrival times. A final conclusion cannot be drawn based on the 4 hour simulation.

_-What is the average throughput time of the customers?_
The simulations average throughput time lies between 1050.73 seconds for C2A and 401.98 seconds A2B. Again, the results differ because of a simulation based on randomness and time. As previously described, most simulation plots have a positive slope and will rise towards infinity over time for A1, B1, A2A, B2A and C2B. The throughput time for A2B and B2B, as mentioned, represent the most stable systems. 


The figures below depict A2B as an almost stable system and C2A with a positive slope.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=4)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_c2a <- plot(arrivals_c2a, metric = "flow_time")
plot_a2b <- plot(arrivals_a2b, metric = "flow_time")

ggarrange(plot_a2b, plot_c2a,
          labels = c("A2B", "C2A"),
          ncol = 1, nrow = 2)

```

## Conclusion
- Considering the service time per service station and assuming the arrival rate of ~30 customers per hour, all systems are not stable. The best system from our simulation can handle at maximum 29.25 customers per hour. 
- When λ is greater or equal to μ the queue becomes infinite long. 
- The occupancy ρ should be below 1, which is the case for all of our simulations. Whatsoever, the best two systems are A2B and B2B.
